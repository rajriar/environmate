<p>A clean environment is essential for healthy living. Our goal at EnvironMate is to provide the
                        community with the most up to date environmental information to keep our communities safe and
                        healthy.
                        We provide a medium for members of the community to report environmental defects in real time to
                        the city's trained
                        environmental clean up crews.</p>
                    <p>From our website you won't need an account to browse potential defects in your area. We welcome
                        anyone to stay informed
                        on the defects that may be present in any community park or gathering place. Make EnvironMate
                        your first step in planning
                        an outing whether it is a date, a playdate, or a casual stroll through the park. A cleaner
                        environment starts with our
